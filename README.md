# Reference Image Widget
Show an image in a tab to help with reference or inspiration.

Load from disk, paste from clipboard, or download from URL.

## Installation
**It is recommended to install this script from the Steam Workshop.**
This script may be updated occasionally.

For advanced (-nosteam) users only, choose an alternate installation method:

- Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KiwifruitDev/sfm_reference_image) into your SourceFilmmaker/game/ directory and add the folder to your gameinfo.txt file.
- Download the [script](https://github.com/KiwifruitDev/sfm_reference_image/blob/main/scripts/sfm/mainmenu/kiwifruitdev/reference_image.py) as a raw *.py file and place it into SourceFilmmaker/game/usermod/scripts/sfm/mainmenu/kiwifruitdev/ (create the folders if they don't exist).

## Usage
This script must be run each time SFM is started.

- Launch Source Filmmaker.
- At the top, click Scripts > kiwifruitdev > reference image.
- When the window appears, select an image source and download or load an image.
- To paste images, select the URL box and press Ctrl+V.

## Known Issues
If your version of Windows does not include the "curl" command, you may need to install it manually.

Testing is very limited, so if you encounter any issues, please report them on the [issues page](https://github.com/KiwifruitDev/sfm_reference_image/issues).

## Notes
The original purpose of this script was to download images from APIs, but it was repurposed for reference images.

Also, window capture support was half-implemented but commented out due to issues.
